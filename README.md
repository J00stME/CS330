1.	How do I approach designing software?
   I now have experience designing graphial scenes using the OpenGL framework.  This framework can be combined with math to make realistic scenes (eg lighting with attenuation)
3.	How do I approach developing programs?
   Being able to zero in on the functions of a program makes it a much simpler endeavor.  I can keep my focus on the scene when finalizing and rendering each object with all of the heavy lifting done in the background.
5.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   Computer Science will help me create programs that can be helpful or fun to my community.
